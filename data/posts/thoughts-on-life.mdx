### This is more like a rant, so you're warned

On 12th of January, 2000 a boy named Alex is born in California, USA. His parents are working couple, mom's a doctor and dad's an engineer. He always gets the attention of his parents. He is raised in a healthy and amazing enviornment, full of opportunities and prosperity.

On the same day another boy named Aditya is born in Delhi, India. His dad is in police and mom's a housewife. He too always gets the attention of his parents. He is raised in a good enviornment not as nice as Alex but still his parents always keep him happy.

A few years pass Alex gets along with his friends and travels around the world, his girlfriend always accompanies him, they are happy together and Alex plans to get into some profession and so does his girlfriend. For Aditya, he right now is preparing for some examinations and then plans to get into a working profession as well.

Suprisingly both Alex and Aditya being so far away think of becoming a Software engineer (all I was able to think lol), Alex starts studying and preparing for Software engineering roles and Aditya has also started after passing the exam he was preparing for. After 5 years both get their first job Alex starts at $150K and Aditya starts at $6K (in India quite common, this is still too much), well comparing the expenses in countries you can justify this.

Reading all that, you might be thinking is this a rant about salary? Naah! $6K is still quite good for freshers in India. I personally worked for $4K lol, and amazingly for more than 10 hours a day (sometimes including weekends). But it isn't about salary or what and how. Born in India I sometimes think why is it that people younger than me are able to do amazing things in thier life and I fail!?

I am quite horrible when it comes to life, sitting in front of my computer 11 hours a day, I keep learning to get myself to their level but I still am always left behind.

It just always amuses me that all this is not because I am dumb or something, its because of the enviornment. Enviornment, believe it or not plays a vital role in our life, you have atleast 70% more chance of living a great life if you're born in a European Country or in the good old United States. A lot of people from those country do not recognize this but its true.

For me 18 years of my life went into 9-10 hours of continous studying and now they are going by because I am gonna be broke if I didn't do something. Opportunities, wait; what are those? What about the disease that you have? And your marks? And what about your health? And what about your family's financial condition? Does that sound too much? 60% of that is a typical Indian family.

For me, travelling within my very own country is 50% of what my family earns; travelling the world? Sorry we don't talk about that here. I would be sitting on the roads asking for bread if I got an economy ticket from here to San Francisco.

The idea of, "Something good will happen!", "Just keep working you will get there.", and other infamous quotes that you'll hear on the internet are too good to be true. The thing is things happen, situations drive situations. Life is random true, but that means its random to you too! You could be working hard all day and still fail. Whereas someone who has enjoyed all his life, get the chance that you wanted!

People who are either born or move to better countries have almost 70% more advantage and you on the other hand are nothing but a walking pile of sadnes. I personally work hard (but still sed lyf), harder than yesterday. Trying to become a better myself and all I get is a chocolate at the end of the day (that sometimes becomes a farcry so be happy eh).

In the end all I can do is be happy (don't forget your masks people) and spread positivity and peace vibes. I am happy because you're happy and living a great life, who cares if you're suffering? We're born to suffer and to find meaning in that suffering is life (thanks Nietzsche).

Now if you're from some good place and saying well you probably don't work as hard as I do (um yeah maybe I mean I know you work for 48 hours in a day).

So what do I want to say? Life is unfair there is no one who is looking over you and things could go worse. If you're someone like me poor enviornment, poor health, just a walking pile of sadness, just know that life is unfair. The word "Privileged few" is a thing and we're certainly not a part of that. So better be ready!
