Let's be honest at some point we have met someone who says that he/she knows everything. Well it could be even be possible that you (no offence) might have been one. And I'll be real honest that I have personally been one ðŸ˜œ!

Nobody likes such people one reason is that if they do this in front of someone who is experienced this could get ugly pretty soon. Its much easier to do this to newbies who don't know much. However what I want to talk about is how to avoid being such a person, from my personal experience.

## The thinking...

What makes you such a guy? A computer, an internet connection, and few tutorials on the internet are enough. Now don't be hard on me every developer does that, however there is a clear difference and understanding when you're really good and when you're not!

This becomes more clear with more experience that one gains for someone who really new to programming, this might become bad. Sometimes making even a simple hello world program makes a newbie feel like "heckerman" (pun intended).
