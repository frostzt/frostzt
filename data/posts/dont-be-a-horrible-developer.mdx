# Don't be a horrible developer!

Let's be honest at some point we have met someone who says that he/she knows everything. Well it could be even be possible that you (no offence) might have been one. And I'll be real honest that I have personally been one ðŸ˜œ!

Nobody likes such people one reason is that if they do this in front of someone who is experienced this could get ugly pretty soon. Its much easier to do this to newbies who don't know much. However what I want to talk about is how to avoid being such a person, from my personal experience.

## The thinking...

What makes you such a guy? A computer, an internet connection, and few tutorials on the internet are enough. Now don't be hard on me every developer does that, however there is a clear difference and understanding when you're really good and when you're not!

This becomes more clear with more experience that one gains for someone who really new to programming, this might become bad. Sometimes making even a simple hello world program makes a newbie feel like "hackerman" (pun intended).

The idea whereas should be, "Yes I am learning, but there is room to improve!". Well then what are somethings that everyone no matter what you should avoid saying?

## Things that will hinder your progress

Here are the things that I have personally heard and sometimes said that only made me look dumb even if I was thinking that I am some Aristotle.

## You don't know everything!

What makes this guy the way he is, <i>"I know this and that and even that, that you think you know!"</i> Don't get confused in the words but know that you don't know everything. No one can know everything.

The Engineering industry is so huge and vast that no matter what you can't just know everything. Think of it, even someone like Linus Torvalds has a limit to what he knows.

## Don't give your opinions if you don't know something (very well)

The first point brings us to this, if you don't know something just accept that you don't know or don't have an idea about it, and therefore you would avoid giving any hard points.

Also avoid giving hard opinions when you don't know something very well. Don't say you haven't met people who don't even have the slightest idea of what Special or General theory of Relativity is and say <i>"Well I believe Einstein was wrong!"</i>.

Such people are avoided, you might shine in front of some newbie by throwing around jargons that you yourself don't understand but against someone who knows his shit you're done.

## Don't be a technology lover

That doesn't mean you should not love Technology in general but technology here refers to frameworks, libraries, or even programming languages. One thing you must know that everything was made with some idea in mind.

Therefore you might meet people who say that JavaScript is better than C++ or that C++ is better than Python or Python is better than "fill in the blank". Don't be that guy.

Every computer programming language ever made has its own use case. Yes when it comes to building web apps JavaScript might better than C++ but if you're talking Systems programming JavaScript stands nowhere near C++.

Just know that everything shines in the work for what it was made, and if there really was one thing that was just perfect won't everyone would be learning it and becoming best in the business?

## Appreciate others' works

Well someone you know just made an awesome application and it looks, feels, and works freaking good. So just don't around becoming a sad and dead pile. Appreciate that hardwork that they did.

Use that as motivation to improve and learn more. Remember life is too short for hating or being jealous of others. So please don't making hating others your full-time job.

## Just be yourself

Remember be original and be yourself. Yes, that quote that you read on the internet applies to this situation as well. When you strive to be better than yourself and you try to be original you improve!

And as a software engineer or developer daily improvement is what you should strive for. This industry changes more frequently than your neighbor's girlfriends so be proactive.
