            He likes to devour books every morning and then sing in the evening. Amazingly he figured out that he had a
            crush on computers and electronics when he completely rekked his Dad&apos;s mobile phone by flashing a wrong
            ROM in it (SPOILER: He fixed it later). Born in India, He has a hunger for knowledge and just want to know
            more; interests ranging from History, Biology, and most of all Mathematics. And unfortunately he
            doesn&apos;t use Arch!
