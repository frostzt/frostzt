        <DetailedDescription>
          Emageically is another side-project that I made it was meant to be integrated with Emage,
          however I thought why not go ahead and make a new one.
          <br />
          <br />
          Emageically is built using TypeScript with Reactjs, the strong typing system provided by
          TS provides a better way to write and structure react code that is fail-safe and easy to
          understand.
          <br />
          <br />
          One specific reason to build something like Emageically was to practice the Masonry layout
          and how can it be created using vanilla CSS and with some help from React.
