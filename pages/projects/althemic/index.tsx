        <DetailedDescription>
          Althemic is a side project that I made it is yet in Alpha stage and registration is almost
          disabled to prevent people from doing meaningless stuff.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is built using Reactjs, Redux, and custom CSS styling. The main reason this project is
          good is because the way I have wrote the code is maintainable. React with Redux gets huge
          very quickly and due to all the boilerplate code involved it gets cumbersome.
          <br />
          <br />
          The project uses Redux Sagas to help with asynchoronous Redux which is the defining
          standard today! I really love Sagas as they help a lot when the project is large and are
          really good and performant. However being experienced with Thunk I think the only thing
          that is involved is the added level of complexity.
